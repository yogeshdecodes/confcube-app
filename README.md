# Gatsby Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) app with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Gatsby project, along with Serverless Functions, with Vercel.

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Gatsby on Vercel, you can use the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ gatsby new gatsby-site
```
