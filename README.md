## Inspiration

Before Covid we generally network with people in tech events physically but after covid everything changes, most events are now hosting online which create no room for participants to network and collabrate with each others. Second reason is that I want to participate in hackathons so I built this project for [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com) hackathon.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
gatsby develop
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.
